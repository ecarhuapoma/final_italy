        <p>Naples, a city in southern Italy, sits on the Bay of Naples. Nearby is Mount Vesuvius, the still-active
            volcano that destroyed nearby Roman town Pompeii. Dating to the 2nd millennium B.C., Naples has centuries of
            important art and architecture. The city's cathedral, the Duomo di San Gennaro, is filled with frescoes.
            Other major landmarks include the lavish Royal Palace and Castel Nuovo, a 13th-century castle.</p>

        <p>Naples' historic city centre is the largest in Europe and has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage
            Site. A wide range of culturally and historically significant sites are nearby, including the Palace of
            Caserta and the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum.</p>
