        <h1>Italian History</h1>

        <p>Little is certain about the history of the Roman Kingdom, as nearly no written records from that time survive, and the histories about it that were written during the Republic and Empire are largely based on legends.</p>

        <h3>Sardinia</h3>
        <p>Sardinia is a large Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea. It has nearly 2,000km of coastline, sandy beaches and a mountainous interior crossed with hiking trails. Its rugged landscape is dotted with thousands of nuraghi – mysterious Bronze Age stone ruins shaped like beehives.</p>

        <p>Sardinia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic. The island's most notable civilization is the indigenous Nuragic, which flourished from the 18th century BC to either 238 BC or the 2nd century AD in some parts of the island, and to the 6th century AD in that part of the island known as Barbagia.</p>

        <h1>LOCAL CUISINE</h1>
        <p>Italian cuisine is a Mediterranean cuisine consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula since antiquity, and later spread around the world together with waves of Italian diaspora.</p>

        <p>Italian cuisine is generally characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation. Ingredients and dishes vary by region. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country.</p>

        <h3> NAPLES</h3>

        <p>Naples, a city in southern Italy, sits on the Bay of Naples. Nearby is Mount Vesuvius, the still-active volcano that destroyed nearby Roman town Pompeii. Dating to the 2nd millennium B.C., Naples has centuries of important art and architecture. The city's cathedral, the Duomo di San Gennaro, is filled with frescoes. Other major landmarks include the lavish Royal Palace and Castel Nuovo, a 13th-century castle.</p>

        <p>Naples' historic city centre is the largest in Europe and has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A wide range of culturally and historically significant sites are nearby, including the Palace of Caserta and the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum.</p>

        <h1>TRAVEL TIPS</h1>
        <p>Cultural quirks, transportation snafus, tax confusion, and how exactly to buy fruit in a supermarket are just a few of the possible challenges you’ll run into while traveling in Italy–and while ultimately getting out of your element is part of the fun of visiting another country, reading through these Italy travel tips will definitely make your experience a bit smoother, especially if it’s your first visit!</p>

        <p>Naples is a very safe place to backpack and travel, but often gets a bad rep for being seedy and more dangerous compared to other places in Italy. Pickpocketing is the most common crime you'll face, and as always, you need to stay vigilant in crowded areas &lpar;especially on public transportation&rpar;.</p>

        <p>Drinking water from the tap in Italy is considered safe. Tap water in the major cities and towns around Italy is safe for consumption, and there are thousands of old-style water fountains dotted around cities, like Rome, where you can fill up water bottles.</p>
