            <p>Little is certain about the history of the Roman Kingdom, as nearly no written records from that time
                survive, and the histories about it that were written during the Republic and Empire are largely based
                on legends.</p>

        <p>Sardinia is a large Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea. It has nearly 2,000km of coastline, sandy
            beaches and a mountainous interior crossed with hiking trails. Its rugged landscape is dotted with thousands
            of nuraghi – mysterious Bronze Age stone ruins shaped like beehives.</p>
    </li>

    <li id="sardinia_body2">
        <p>Sardinia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic. The island's most notable civilization is the indigenous
            Nuragic, which flourished from the 18th century BC to either 238 BC or the 2nd century AD in some parts of
            the island, and to the 6th century AD in that part of the island known as Barbagia.</p>
