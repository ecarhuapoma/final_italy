            <p>Italian cuisine is a Mediterranean cuisine consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques
                developed across the Italian Peninsula since antiquity, and later spread around the world together with
                waves of Italian diaspora.</p>
            <div id="bottom_text"><p>Italian cuisine is generally characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four
                main ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate
                preparation. Ingredients and dishes vary by region. Many dishes that were once regional have
                proliferated with variations throughout the country.</p>
